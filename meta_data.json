Define the Mp3 file you want to play and the colors for your audio slider using the property editor. \n\nThe element itself comes with the audio slider only. But you can create your own play, pause, skip, and stop buttons using the custom audio player's element actions in your workflows. \n\nCustom Audio Player's \"Current Time\" will display the current time of your audio file as a string formatted as HH:MM:SS \n\nCustom Audio Player's \"Duration\" will display the length of your audio file as a string formatted as HH:MM:SS"
